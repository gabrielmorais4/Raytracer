# Raytracer-EPITECH

## Projet **Raytracer**
A raytracer is a 3D rendering algorithm that differs significantly from the rendering algorithms employed in the gaming industry. It utilizes a technique known as "ray tracing," which relies on intersection calculations. Ray tracing demands substantial computational power, rendering it impractical for real-time rendering. However, it excels in achieving a level of photorealism that makes it the preferred method for rendering special effects, particularly in fields like filmmaking.

## Usage
- use "make" command
- "./raytracer scene1.json > result.ppm"
The *.json file is where the scene configuration is made, you can change the geometric shapes, their positions, the light incidence and position, etc...
